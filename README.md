Odin Recipes project, practice basic HTML.

We'll use basic HTML tags, it will take some work to do the most basic
elements in a webpage, but it's important to know the fundamentals of
HTML in order to understand what the hell are you doing when taking
frameworks, templates and tools avialable on the internet that automate
the design and appeal of the elements showed in a webpage.

The things that I'll practce will be:
- HTML boilerplate
- HTML elementes made using tags:
 * Headers <h1>
 * Paragraphs <p>
 * Ordered and unordered tags: <ol> <ul>
 * Text with different meanings: <strong> & <b>, <em> & <i>
 * Links <a>
 * Images <img>
